## Introduction

The DE10-Nano development kit is a powerful platform for developing FPGA-based applications. This repository aims to provide a collection of Quartus Prime projects on the DE10-Nano board. Each project is implemented in Verilog, a hardware description language widely used in FPGA implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use the projects in this repository, you need to have the following software and hardware components:

1. Quartus Prime: Make sure you have Quartus Prime installed on your development machine. You can download the latest version of Quartus Prime from the Intel website.

2. DE10-Nano Development Kit: You need to have the DE10-Nano development kit, which is based on the Cyclone V FPGA. Pin assignment for the projects is based on schematics of DE10-Nano. If you're using any other FPGA, make sure to change the pin assignment by taking schematics as reference.

### Implementation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/AbhiramMundru/verilogWorkspace.git 


2. Open the Quartus Prime software and select the desired project from the repository.

3. Follow the project-specific instructions provided in the project's README file to build, program, and test the project on the DE10-Nano development kit.
